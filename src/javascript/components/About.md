## About

### Purpose

The purpose of the _luox_ platform is to faciliate the calculation of quantities related to light and lighting in a user-friendly, open-access and free fashion. Users can upload spectra (which are only stored in the browser) and the platform will calculate relevant quantites (including (il)luminance, chromaticity, and α-opic (ir)radiance and α-opic daylight (il)luminances) from the spectra, generate a visualisation of the spectrum, and enable the export of calculations in tabular form. All quantities reported here are supported by the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE)](https://cie.co.at/).

The platform is primarily geared towards researchers and research users interested in the effects of light exposure on human physiology and behaviour, but it may be interesting to students, academics and professionals in other disciplines and areas.

_luox_ is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Team

This platform was developed by [Dr Manuel Spitschan](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/manuel-spitschan) (Department of Experimental Psychology, Unversity of Oxford) and [Go Free Range](https://gofreerange.com/).

#### Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

##### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

##### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

## Usage

### Quick start

We provide a documented wizard for uploading your files to the platform.

### Sharing spectra and calculations using sharing URL

Spectra and calculations within the luox platform can be shared using an URL that directly encodes the uploaded spectrum/spectra using Michael Herf's [spdurl](https://github.com/herf/spdurl) package. The sharing URL will open a view-only version of the platform. To copy the sharing URL, scroll down to the bottom of the page. Before sharing the URL, please double-check that it opens spectrum/spectra as expected.

### Requesting DOI for sharing URL

We offer the option to request a digital object identifier (DOI) linked to the sharing URL. This DOI has to be requested manually and the request will be vetted manually. To request a DOI, please complete this [form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=G96VzPWXk0-0uv5ouFLPkZQkeC9QuStHlpH3Nt-sDo1URExCVlBCNFdNWk02TDVVVFhYSkUyMUxETi4u). The DOI will be generated by generating an entry for the sharing URL in the [Oxford University Research Archive (ORA)](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/) and author information will be included in the record. All luox sharing URLs added to ORA will receive a unique luox number of the format (`YYYY-####`; `Y`=year). A running list of luox sharing URLs with associated DOIs is on this page, under [Depositions](#depositions). Please note that deposition of the sharing URL into ORA is permanent.

There is no guarantee that DOI requests will be accepted. To ensure that a DOI is generated in a timely fashion, please submit the request well before it is needed (e.g. in a publication submission). We are currently investigating the possibility of generating DOIs directly without using ORA.

## Under the hood

### Calculation definitions

All calculations performed here following guidance from the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE)](https://cie.co.at/).

### Precision and decimal points

All calculations are computed with floating point precision using JavaScript. In the browser, the results are displayed up to four decimals for all quantities (including those in _Advanced_ mode). When downloading calculations, the precision will be higher than displayed in the browser.

### Implementation specifics

While calculation procedures are structurally well-defined by the CIE, there are a few ambiguities that may arise when implementing it. This includes the choice of specific and exchangeable algorithms (e.g. for the calculation of CCT), and the decimal points of specific constants. The specific choices are described here:

| Aspect                                         | Quantity                                          | Method or quantity used in luox | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The CIE endorses this software having made a black-box evaluation of the software as of Feb. 11, 2021, finding that the software performs satisfactorily. This software is not a replacement for the CIE publications and works from which it is derived. The user is advised to consult the original publications and works for proper understanding of and calculation of the result of this software.

### Alternatives

The CIE has released a toolbox (DOI: [10.25039/S026.2018.TB](https://doi.org/10.25039/S026.2018.TB)) and user guide (DOI: [10.25039/S026.2018.UG](https://doi.org/10.25039/S026.2018.UG)) for calculations of quantities specified in [CIE S 026/E:2018: CIE System for Metrology of Optical Radiation for ipRGC-Influenced Responses to Light](http://cie.co.at/publications/cie-system-metrology-optical-radiation-iprgc-influenced-responses-light-0) (DOI: [10.25039/S026.2018](https://doi.org/10.25039/S026.2018)). The Excel spreadsheet-based toolbox is freely available and is supplementary to the luox platform.
